## Authentication

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I create an access token?">
    **Via Fly Web:**
    1. Go to **Settings** → **Access Tokens**
    2. Click **Create Token**
    3. Set name, expiration, and scopes
    4. Copy and save the token securely

    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How does OIDC authentication work?">
    OIDC (OpenID Connect) allows CI/CD pipelines to authenticate without stored secrets:

    3. Use the Fly GitHub Action
    
    ```yaml
    - uses: jfrog/fly-action@v1
      with:
        url: ${{ vars.FLY_URL }}
    ```
    
    Fly validates the OIDC token from your CI provider and grants temporary access.

    Generate a new token:
    
    ```bash
    fly auth token create --name "New Token" --expiry 90d

## Publishing & Artifacts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I publish a package?">
    **Using Fly CLI:**
    ```bash
    fly publish
    ```
    
    **Using native package manager:**
    ```bash
    npm publish        # npm
    twine upload dist/* # Python
    docker push ...    # Docker
    ```
    
    Fly automatically links published artifacts to your Git commit.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I publish different package types from the same project?">
    Yes! Fly supports publishing multiple artifact types from a single project. For example, you can publish both an npm package and a Docker image from the same repository.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I delete a published artifact?">
    **Via Fly Web:**
    1. Navigate to the artifact
    2. Click **Actions** → **Delete**
    3. Confirm deletion
    
    **Via CLI:**
    ```bash
    fly unpublish @myteam/package@1.0.0
    ```
    
    <Warning>
      Deleting artifacts may break dependent packages.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why does my artifact show 'No Git info'?">
    This happens when Fly can't link the artifact to a Git commit. Ensure:
    
    1. You're publishing from within a Git repository
    2. The repository is connected in Fly Web
    3. You have committed your changes before publishing
    
    Use `fly publish --git-tag` to automatically create a Git tag.
