## Common Workflows

### Consuming Packages

Pull packages from your Fly Registry:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="npm">
    ```bash
    # Packages are automatically resolved from Fly Registry
    npm install @myteam/shared-utils
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="pip">
    ```bash
    # Install from Fly Registry
    pip install my-internal-package
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Maven">
    ```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.myteam</groupId>
      <artifactId>shared-utils</artifactId>
      <version>1.2.0</version>
    </dependency>
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Docker">
    ```bash
    docker pull myteam.jfrog.io/docker/my-app:latest
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Publishing Packages

Publish new versions to your Fly Registry:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="npm">
    ```bash
    # Publish with Fly CLI
    fly publish
    
    # Or use npm directly
    npm publish
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="pip">
    ```bash
    # Publish with Fly CLI
    fly publish
    
    # Or use twine
    twine upload dist/*
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Docker">
    ```bash
    # Tag and push
    docker tag my-app:latest myteam.jfrog.io/docker/my-app:1.0.0
    docker push myteam.jfrog.io/docker/my-app:1.0.0
    
    # Or use Fly CLI
    fly docker push my-app:1.0.0
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Agentic Development

With the Fly Desktop App integrated into your IDE, you can use natural language commands:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Search Artifacts" icon="magnifying-glass" defaultOpen>
    ```
    "Find all versions of the auth service from last week"
    "Search for packages that handle user authentication"
    "What version is deployed in production?"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Manage Releases" icon="tag">
    ```
    "Create a release for version 2.0.0"
    "What changed since the last release?"
    "Generate release notes for this version"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Configure Pipelines" icon="gears">
    ```
    "Set up my GitHub Actions to publish to Fly"
    "Configure Docker builds for this project"
    "Add Fly to my CI pipeline"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Deploy" icon="rocket">
    ```
    "Deploy version 1.5.0 to staging"
    "Roll back to the previous version"
    "What's the deployment status?"
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Semantic Versioning" icon="code-branch">
    Use semantic versioning (semver) for all packages. Fly automatically tracks and validates versions.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Git Tagging" icon="tag">
    Tag releases in Git. Fly links artifacts to tags for complete traceability.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Environment Separation" icon="layer-group">
    Use separate environments (dev, staging, prod) with appropriate access controls.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Automated Publishing" icon="robot">
    Set up CI/CD to publish on merge to main or on tag creation.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
