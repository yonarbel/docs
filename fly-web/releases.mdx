## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Missing Artifacts" icon="box-open">
    **Symptoms:** Release shows fewer artifacts than expected
    
    **Possible causes:**
    - Build failed for some packages
    - Artifacts published to different repository
    - Version mismatch
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. Check workflow logs for build failures
    2. Verify artifact versions match release version
    3. Manually add missing artifacts
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Auto-Generation Failed" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    **Symptoms:** Release notes generation returns empty or error
    
    **Possible causes:**
    - No commits between releases
    - Git repository disconnected
    - API rate limiting
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. Verify commits exist between versions
    2. Check Git connection status
    3. Try again after a few minutes
  </Accordion>
