### Quick Actions

Fly Chat can execute actions directly:

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| "Publish current project" | Opens publish dialog |
| "Create a release" | Opens release creation |
| "Generate access token" | Opens token creation |
| "Connect a repository" | Opens Git connection |

---

## Context Awareness

### Project Context

When used in the Desktop App/IDE, Fly Chat understands your current project:

```
"Publish this package" → Uses current project's package.json
"What version is this?" → Checks current project version
"Update dependencies" → Analyzes project's dependencies
```

### Repository Context

In Fly Web, Fly Chat understands the current page context:

```
(On artifact page) "Show me older versions" → Shows that artifact's versions
(On release page) "Compare to previous" → Compares current release
(On repo page) "What's been published?" → Shows repo's artifacts
```

---

## Advanced Usage

### Multi-Step Workflows

Chain commands together:

```
"Find the auth-service, check what version is in production, 
and tell me what changed since the last deployment"
```

### Comparative Analysis

```
"Compare our utils package with lodash - what's the size difference?"
"How many downloads did we have this month vs last month?"
"Which package has the most dependencies?"
```

### Troubleshooting

```
"Why did my publish fail?"
"What's wrong with my workflow?"
"Help me debug this deployment error: [paste error]"
```
